    "## EEA Model\n",
    "Manipulating the EEA Aviation Emissions Calculator via the Python library PyCel is slow. Reading the \"Climb, cruise, descent\" stage length (NM) information from the Excel model for a flight with an Airbus A320 takes about 3.5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is not the development of a Python implementation of the EEA Aviation Emissions Calculator. Therefore, we do not focus on increasing the excecution speed of the Excel model in Python. Instead, we cache the information. The model is executed in Excel with standard settings for each aircraft that should be covered by LCAero. The results (emissions) are cached in a CSV file that can be imported by a Python script without analyzing the spreadsheet again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add simple explaination of EEA model to report, explain different flight phases, etc.\n",
    "- Define LTO and CCD stage length\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other life data\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight cycles is very hard to determine as there are so many variables. Every airline has its own rules on this. There is not an x amount of maximum flying cycles a seat or galley is designed for. \n",
    "It also varies per product (seat, galley, lavatory etc) and sort of aircraft and mission (low cost vs. full service, long haul vs short/medium range).\n",
    "\n",
    "A low cost airline has much more wear and tear on the seats, carpet (sometimes 8-10 short flight cycles a day) but these aircraft have less wear and tear on the galley as there is much less on board service and catering available and also less wear and tear on the lavatory since people use the bathroom less on short flights. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example a Boeing 737 from KLM (full service airline with maybe max 4 flights a day with catering) will have a completely different interior replacement schedule than a Boeing 737 from Ryanair (low cost with maybe 8 to 10 flight a day and no catering) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is a difference in long haul and short range. The latter has much more flying cycles and therefore the seats and carpets wear much faster as there are more people moving through the isle and using the overhead bins during one day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seats and lavatories are usually replaced when the aircraft is checked during a C- check . This can be a certain time frame (e.g. 2 years) or 2000-3000 flight cycles.\n",
    "Galleys are replaced during D-checks (every 10 years, or 10000-15000 cycles) but not per se during every D check. Depends on how long the airline is planning to continue flying with the A/C\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is not a definitive answer on the number of flight cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria like environmental performance is now being introduced within the airline industry. But it is very new for most. For some airlines ((Northern) Europe) this is  a factor that they take into account when replacing equipment. This applies especially to airlines that are (partially) owned by the local government as they usually set is as a requirement for new purchases. For others it is not important at all (Africa , Central Asia and Middle East).\n",
