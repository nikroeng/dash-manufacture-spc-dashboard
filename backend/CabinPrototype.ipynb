    "The 230 gallons of waste from an average long-haul 747 trip equates to 0.55 gallons per flush per passenger, which is significantly less than the 3.5 gallons land-based toilets go through per flush. But it’s still nearly one ton in extra weight, or thousands of dollars in overweight baggage fees.\n",

    "Especially when new propulsion technologies will approach the market, LCAero can have a big impact in communicating the impact differences of different technologies. This could already become relevant in the mid-term when airlines may start mixing kerosine with a certain share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The passengers would not notice any difference if the flight is powered by 5, 20, or 80 % SAF, but LCAero will tell them what matters!\n",
